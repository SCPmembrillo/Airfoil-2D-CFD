## Geometry and Domain
The geometry of the NACA 2412 airfoil is imported from Airfoil Tools, where a rectangular domain of 20 m × 10 m is created, as shown below.

The domain is subdivided into internal, intermediate, and external regions.
## Mesh
The simulations are performed under standard sea-level conditions, i.e., ρ = 1.225 kg/m^3 and μ = 1.789 × 10^-5 Pa·s. The airfoil chord length is 1 m.
