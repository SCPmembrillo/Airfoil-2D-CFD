## Geometry and Domain
The geometry of the NACA 2412 airfoil is imported from Airfoil Tools, where a rectangular domain of 20 m × 10 m is created, as shown below. The domain is subdivided into internal, intermediate, and external regions.
## Mesh
The simulations are performed under standard sea-level conditions, i.e., ρ = 1.225 kg/m³ and μ = 1.789 × 10⁻⁵ Pa·s. The airfoil chord length is 1 m.
